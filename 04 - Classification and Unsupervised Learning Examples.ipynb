    "# Classification and Unsupervised Learning Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, you will need to explore your data before developing a machine learning model. This is often the case when you have a big batch of data and you are not sure yet how you want to classify it, but you know it will classify into parts. Some example of this might be the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- DNA fingerprints (what genetic patterns emerge accross samples?)\n",
    "- Photos of animals (what animal types/groups appear?)\n",
    "- Web traffic (what properties clump related queries together?)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the below example, we will generate some fake data, pretending this data represents photos of some animals.\n",
    "We will use clustering to automatically group these photos into related clumps so we can then review the data and see for ourselves why the automated clustering alorithm thought they should be grouped together."
